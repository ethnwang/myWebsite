		<p>Take in a file that contains a multi-level maze and uses Depth First Search and Breadth First Search to solve it. Traverse through multiple levels and obstacles given different routing schemes designated by command line arguments.
            This project was implemented in C++ and primarily works with file input and output,  stacks, and queues while minimizing runtime speed as well as memory usage.
