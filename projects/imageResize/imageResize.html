		<h1>Computer Vision | Image Resizing Program</h1>
		<!-- Header -->
		<p>
            I programmed a basic form of the seam-carving algorithm to crop images (otherwise known as “retargeting”) to a desired height x width so that we can change the aspect ratio without distorting the image. 
This project was implemented in C++ and primarily works with pointers, arrays, structs, strings, and basic I/O operations, as well as C-style “object-based” programming.
