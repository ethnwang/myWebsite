		<h1>My Very Own Website</h1>
		<!-- Header -->
		<p>You are looking at it! This is my official website that I have created from scratch all by myself! I used HTML, CSS, and JS to make this website as well as netlify to publish it. 
       This was a pretty fun project and as I improve upon my HTML/CSS/JS this website will continue to look better and better!
       I will also update this website as time goes on with my projects and possibly what goes on in my life in the future!
