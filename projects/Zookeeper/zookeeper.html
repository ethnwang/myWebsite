            Finding the shortest path between every single cage in a zoo given restrictions of which cages can connect to which cages.
Devise the shortest underground cyclic water canal that passes through all cages once by the traveling salesperson problem.
This project was implemented in C++ and primarily works with MST and TSP Algorithms, branch and bound algorithm, as well as utilizing several heuristic approaches to achieve a nearly-optimal solution while minimizing runtime speed as well as memory usage.
