            Hold off and survive a zombie attack by designating which zombies must be killed first based off of their distance, speed, and health.
Based on the modes provided by command-line arguments, provide statistics of zombies killed such as order of deaths, which zombies killed, which zombies move, last N zombies killed, most active zombies, etc.
This project was implemented in C++ and primarily works with several types of priority queues, templated code, inheritance, dynamic polymorphism, file input and output, and efficient data structures and algorithms while minimizing runtime speed as well as memory usage.
